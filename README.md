# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my personal solutions and notes as I practice:

- **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)**  
  Core problem-solving with arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, recursion, and more.

- **SQL**  
  Practice with database queries, joins, aggregations, and advanced filtering using LeetCode SQL problems.

- **Interview Questions**  
  Solve problems from common interview patterns like Top 100 Liked Questions, and others frequently asked in technical interviews.

Each solution includes code, explanations (when helpful), and notes on edge cases or time complexity.
